# Hive Post Evolution

This project aims to implement a standard for supporting advanced post features across Hive frontends. [See the deployed version at hive-post-evolution.vercel.app](https://hive-post-evolution.vercel.app/).

This repository showcases a basic implementation in React and Tailwind CSS to render posts with the Hive Post Evolution standard to serve as guidance for frontends for their own implementation.
